								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul Lukach, Executive Director of the Crime Victim Center of Erie County, is the first to admit it: he and his employees don’t pride themselves on being technology savvy.

<p>With so much at stake, they turned to NanoSoft Solutions to handle their IT needs. NanoSoft not only created detailed plan to upgrade MCMS systems, but when an old modem died over a weekend, putting in jeopardy the MCMS e-mail capabilities, it was NanoSoft who came to the rescue. As Christopher Bell from MCMS says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We don’t pride ourselves on being technologically savvy, our job is to serve people in times of crisis.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s that 24 hour/7 day a week support and commitment to service that keeps the MCMS from worrying anymore about their IT.</p>
